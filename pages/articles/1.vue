  Israel is a country that's using the holocaust as it's personal 'we are the victim' card. Whenever something is said against the Israelis, it's anti-semitism, but brutally murdering women, children in the holy month of ramadan, and kicking people out of their homes is just self defense, And Israel says that there's an Iranian nuclear crisis because of Iran's covert nuclear program, but why aren't we talking about an Israeli nuclear crisis, this is just hypocrisy at its finest. Israel had an undercover nuclear program, and is estimated to have 80 - 400 nuclear warheads, however all Israel does is play the victim. Israel is not defending itself, it is killing innocent people and then playing the victim, there is also an issue with how global media handles this, they say that Israelis are killed, while Palestinians simply die. With America aiding Israel, no one is holding the zionists accountable. Israel is breaking international law constantly, The occupation in East Jerusalem is considered illegal, however no one speaks of it, Many families were evicted in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood to make space for Jewish Settlers. There were many Palestinians that were shot to death by IDF soldiers, and there are many Palestinians that are jailed. Back in September 2020, there were 167 detained children in Israeli prisons, majority of these 167 Palestinian minors were in the ages of 16-18, and at its peak in March 2016, 440 children were locked up. On 23 October 2021, 20 residents of Turmusaya, had gone to harvest olives, when they were harvesting, Jewish settlers had shown up and had incited violence against them, The settlers had also beat an 80 year old woman and and 18 year old with clubs, while two Palestinians were also pepper-sprayed by the settlers, a 10 year old and a 16 year old also were injured from stones thrown by the settlers, Two Israeli military jeeps drove up and the soldiers fired tear gas and rubber coated bullets at the residents. Such attacks are used as a way to take over Palestinian lands in the west bank. A 7 year old was detained on 16th of December 2021, and his mother was also threatened by Israeli Soldiers. Time to sum it up, Israel is violating human rights, killing people, arresting children, all while taking over Palestinian lands.

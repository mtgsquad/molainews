    "alej": "After Pakistan's Former Prime Minister was ousted in a no-confidence vote, there has been political unrest, seeing that Shahbaz Sharif has come to power. The vote required 172 votes in the 342 seated parliament, was supported by 174. Even after Imran Khan was forced out of office, there is now a political crisis, with larger and larger political rallies, is heating up the matter. The former PM, also accused the United States of teaming up with the opposition to defeat the then PM, As said by Khan, 'I will not accept an imported government, I'm ready for a struggle.', However, Imran Khan tried to delay the bote by desolving parliament and trying to have early elections, however that attempt failed as the Supreme Court ordered for the no-confidence vote. It seems as though this is the culture in our nation, because no PM has completed five years in office, in the nation's history. At this point, it seems that Imran Khan plans on gaining supporters, and getting ready for the next election polls, which will be held in 2023."
